# Assignment Tracker++

In all honesty, this is a minor, scuffed, and unfinished modification of the chrome plugin [assignment-tracker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/assignment-tracker/majicckffndkgmkcdbgccohoclphnkhg) by [Catherine Zeng](https://github.com/yczeng).
To install, follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16680682/how-to-modify-an-extension-from-the-chrome-web-store).

## Current state:

It has a bad darkmode, configurable via chrome://extensions.

## Todo:

* Allow option to pull colors from chrome theme.
* Port to firefox.
